# My Awesome Project
This is an advice generating app that pulls quotes from the API provided by the client.  The client provided a mockup of how they wanted it to lookk and a style guide listing the colors to use.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

This components were made with HTML and was styled with CSS using the colors provided in the client's style guide.  JavaScript was used to get to query the API and then fill in the number next to advice and place the quote received into the appropriate section.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned to read the API documentation a bit more before diving in.  Some of the initial errors I ran across would have been resovled early in the process had I just read a bit more of the documentation.
